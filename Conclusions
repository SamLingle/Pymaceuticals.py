Based on the evidence seen in the charts I can say with confidence that:
1. The drug Capomulin consistently brings down tumor growth over the 45 day period compared to the others evaluated.

2. Capomulin also caused fewer mouse deaths over the 45 day treatment period compared to the other sampled drug schedules/

3. Metastic site growth was lower on average across all of the drug treatments than growth seen in the placebo data.
